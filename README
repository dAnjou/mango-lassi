README for herzi's mango-lassi
==============================

This repository is created to do some development on Mango Lassi (which was
originally written by Lennart PÃ¶ttering). He asked me to simply fork his
project to apply the changes I'm considering to add.

Website:   http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/mango-lassi.html

Changes made in this tree:
 * added the patches from mango-lassi.sf.net (to fix some crashes and implement
   screen reordering)
 * add a menu item and a logo
 * be less verbose on the console (unless --verbose gets passed)
 * improved OSD overlays (only the background is transparent, the text and icon
   are opaque -- unless no RGBA colormap is available, then the display is the
   same)
